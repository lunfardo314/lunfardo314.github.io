About Proxima
===

Proxima presents a novel architecture for a distributed ledger, commonly referred to as a *blockchain*.

- Proxima is as decentralized and permissionless as Bitcoin (*proof-of-work*, PoW).
- Proxima is similar to *proof-of stake* (PoS) due to its approach to the Sybil-protection, its energy-efficiency and high throughput.

Yet it is neither PoW, nor a PoS system. It is based on **cooperative consensus**.

In short, the *cooperative consensus* is ultimately achieved among token holders following a rule of how UTXO transactions should be produced, akin the *longest chain rule* of PoW blockhains, which enforces how blocks should be produced. The rule, called **biggest ledger coverage** rule, is an optimal strategy in the game-theoretical sense, i.e. it leads to Nash equilibrium among profit-seeking token holders, just like the *longest chain rule* is optimal for Bitcoin miners.

Token holders are the only category of users which has genuine and vested interest in any distributed ledger. In blockchains, third parties, miners or validators, must be incentivized to maintain consensus of the ledger state on behalf of the users. The extent of decentralization and security of the blockchain strictly depends on how decentralized its miners/validators are.

Proxima takes a different approach: the end-users -- token holders -- themselves maintain consensus on the ledger state by cooperating with each other. It removes the need for any incentivized third parties with their specific interests and behaviors.

The philosophy of Proxima is **social consensus**, **equity** and **cooperation** among stakeholders of the distributed ledger.
