# On definition of Nakamoto consensus
_Beyond PoW_

([link to the Medium post](https://medium.com/@lunfardo/on-definition-of-nakamoto-consensus-be8f4b84c899))

## Motivation
This article is a conceptual reflection aimed at educated crypto-natives, professionals, and thinkers. Our goal is to reframe the idea of _Nakamoto consensus_ to include truly decentralized, permissionless systems beyond just PoW. Rather than presenting a formal academic argument, we offer a grounded, informal definition and explore its implications.

The _Nakamoto consensus_, when used as a proper name, is a consensus protocol of Bitcoin, which means PoW and the _longest chain rule_.

Quite often, however, the _Nakamoto consensus_ is used as a descriptive term, when referring to permissionless or probabilistic properties of the protocol - even though, in its generic form, these concepts are vaguely defined and potentially misleading.

We believe the unique characteristics of proper _Nakamoto consensus_ could - and should - be abstracted away from specific mechanisms used to achieve them. Sticking to the particularities of PoW and the longest chain rule prevents us from seeing the true paradigm shift pioneered by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Understanding Nakamoto consensus as a class of incentive-driven, permissionless protocols - not just a PoW mechanism - opens the door to deeper innovation. If we want decentralization to evolve, we must abstract the vision without discarding its core.

## Definition
Here we propose the following informal definition for the generic term _Nakamoto consensus_:

> **Nakamoto consensus** is a protocol for maintaining consensus on the state of a **public distributed ledger** operated by an **undetermined set of players**.

_Undetermined set of players_ means "a set not known at either the protocol level or the level of individual players." It is a non-deterministic set in the sense that each player may have a different perception of the set, since knowledge about it is never complete and is affected by random factors.

_Public distributed ledger_ is essential here. It explicitly refers to the real socio-economic environment. That is, it isn't merely a consensus model based on standard assumptions about communication (e.g. synchronicity), node honesty or maliciousness, adversary models, or similar but also includes real-world players who own assets recorded on the ledger, and their interests. We are not talking about consensus on an arbitrary value (as in BFT models), but rather about a distributed (shared) ledger of transactions that records ownership of assets.

_The undetermined set of players_ is logically equivalent to the assumption of _permissionlessness_, where players can join or leave at will or due to random factors.

We observe that _probabilistic (subjective) finality_ is a direct implication of _permissionlessness_, since we can't speak of final consensus among players if we don't know who the players are - or even how many of them there are.

The above implies the following necessary conditions for such a protocol to exist as a real system - and thus the characteristic traits of _Nakamoto consensus_ - that can also be considered as part of the definition:

- **Liquidity** of on-ledger assets. That is, _Nakamoto consensus_ always assumes on-ledger assets can be traded against real-world assets in a permissionless way.
- **Incentives**. Profitability of engagement is what motivates players to participate in the _Nakamoto consensus_. The _liquidity_ enables the profit-seeking part.
- **Consensus rule**. Profit-seeking behavior is behind all public blockchains, even permissioned ones. However, what distinguishes Nakamoto-style systems is the existence of an **optimal profit-seeking strategy** (in the game-theoretical sense)- a simple behavioral rule that results in a **Nash equilibrium** and **leads to consensus** among independent players, is characteristic to permissionless environments. The consensus rule is usually "oblivious" to the history of communications and is based on a bounded locally available fragment of the non-deterministic global state. Examples include the _longest chain rule_ in Bitcoin, the _GHOST rule_ in [Kaspa](https://kaspa.org/), _heaviest chain rule_ in [Ouroboros](https://cardano.org/) and the [_biggest coverage rule_](/overview/consensus.md) in Proxima.

## Permissionlessness. Degrees of being permissionless
There's no doubt that being _permissionless_ is a hallmark of _Nakamoto consensus_. However, the term is often used too loosely in the crypto space and can be misleading.

Fortunately, we have a rigorous framework for reasoning about permissionlessness in the excellent article _Permissionless Consensus_ (Lewis-Pye, Roughgarden, [arxiv.org/abs/2304.14701](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14701)). It explores the subject in detail and presents a number of formal models and results. The _impossibility_ results make the implications of being permissionless very clear.

The article proposes the following hierarchy of permissionlessness and provides rigorous mathematical models for each:

1. **Fully permissionless setting**. No knowledge of the player set. PoW protocols are typically interpreted as operating in this setting.
2. **Dynamically available setting**: A protocol knows a (dynamically evolving) list of identifiers (e.g., public keys associated with locked-up stake). Importantly, the evolution of this list can be a function of the protocol's execution, and different players may have different views of this list (i.e., it is a non-deterministic set). Membership in this list is a necessary condition for participating in the protocol at a particular time.
PoS longest-chain protocols are typically interpreted as operating in this setting (e.g. Ouroboros).
3. **Quasi-permissionless setting**: The current participants are all of the identifiers in the set above. PoS PBFT-style protocols are typically interpreted as operating in this setting (e.g. Algorand, SUI).

## Nakamoto Permissionlessness
We consider only settings 1 and 2 to be _Nakamoto permissionless_, while the committee-based PBFT-style approach clearly deviates from Satoshi's vision in this regard.
Roughly speaking, the essential difference between 1 and 2 is that:

- 1 refers to an undetermined set of **anonymous** players, whose participation in the protocol is entirely voluntary.
- 2 refers to an undetermined set of **pseudonymous** players, who also participate voluntarily. However, the actual participants of the consensus usually form a non-deterministic (subjectively perceived) subset of the larger set.

The aforementioned article formally proves an essential difference between the assumptions in settings 1 and 2: some things that are impossible in 1 become possible in 2.

Setting 2 seems to model the set of on-chain stakers, who enter or leave the set at will. However, their actual participation is determined by protocol mechanics (e.g., leader selection) or by random factors such as being online or offline.

It may be tempting to take a "maximalist" stance and reject setting 2 as not decentralized enough. However, in our view, both 1 and 2 should be considered _Nakamoto permissionless_. Here's our reasoning:

- Both 1 and 2 are consistent with our informal definition of _Nakamoto consensus_.
- Both 1 and 2 are probabilisticâ€”one of the main traits of _Nakamoto consensus_ (see formal results; also Ouroboros, the longest-chain version).
- Considering only 1 would be too limiting in practice, especially taking into account the unsustainable cost profile of PoW protocols.
- The choice between 1 and 2 is not binary; there is a range. For example, cooperative consensus (Proxima) approaches 1 very closely, but without following the paradigm of either 1 or 2.

## Refined definition

So, a slightly modified version of the definition:

> The Nakamoto protocol is a system that is permissionless in the sense of settings 1 and 2, where players seek profit by interacting with assets according to an optimal strategy (a Nash equilibrium) emerging from the ledger's validity constraints.

We want to emphasize that in our definition of the _Nakamoto consensus_, the behavioral assumption of profit-seeking (the incentives) is essential. In our opinion, the _Nakamoto consensus_ has no meaning outside the real socio-economic environment.
